# odin-recipes
This is one of the TOP (The Odin Project) foundations lesson.
In this project I will be making a very basic website with several links to recipes.

-- Goals --
1. Getting used to git workflow and the different git commands.
2. Using the different stages on git efficiently and when to commit.
3. Adding good descriptions.
4. Getting used to work with the CLI instead of the GUI.
5. Using github to create and update a repository.
6. Using HTML to create the website.

-- Background until now --
I have been following lessons on TOP and learning how to use the terminal, working with the CLI, starting on git and github.
Until now, for the sake of better learning, I have learned all these different skills separatedly, and this is the first proper project (even if it's very basic) that I'm going to build from scratch.
